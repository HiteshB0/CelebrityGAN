The file.ipynb has a Celebrity Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which has a generator class (responsible for generating images based on training data) and a discriminator class (responsible to distinguish images between real or fake which helps improve the model). The model performs better after more epochs and results in a similar realistic Celebrity face image output.
